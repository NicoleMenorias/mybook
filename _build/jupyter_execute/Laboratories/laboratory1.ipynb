    "Dr. Jake is a medical doctor and the CEO of Astro JR, a giant pharmaceutical company in the Philippines. To support the production and use of AstroJR's COVID19 vaccine, this company has implemented a number of business intelligence and data analytics tools. Your task is to provide the appropriate and necessary analytical questions Dr. Jake must ask his analytics team in order to provide better deployment and production of COVID19 vaccines around the world using descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.\n",
