# Deep Learning Portfolio

**Owner: Nicole S. Menorias**

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Portfolio**, a collection of projects, lectures, and laboratory work that demonstrate my journey in machine learning and AI.  

This book is organized into sections to make it easy to explore different aspects of my work:

- **Projects** → end-to-end deep learning applications and experiments  
- **Lectures** → study notes, concepts, and key ideas in AI and neural networks  
- **Laboratories** → hands-on coding exercises, model implementations, and practice tasks  

You can navigate through the sections using the sidebar or the table of contents below.
